           <p>As covered in <a href="#greece">an earlier post</a>, there is reason to believe our ancestors saw the world much differently than we do. Our bronze was their blue. Our violet was their white. It might be because they had fewer words for colors than we do, which caused them to actually see them differently. Even more shocking: this phenomenon might be going on today.</p>

            <p>The Himba tribe in Namibia don't have a word for blue. Instead they have a word that covers medium-dark colors including blue, maroon and some dark greens. But they also have many, many others words for green, targeting various shades, tints and hues. </p>
            

            <figure><img src="images/himba/himbaPhoto1.png" /><div class="citation">Vidipedia/Himba Color Experiment</div><figcaption>A Himba volunteer having troubling picking out the blue square.</figcaption></figure>




            <p> In 2005, <a href="http://www.vidipedia.org/index.php?option=com_hwdmediashare&view=mediaitem&id=166413:himba-colour-experiment&Itemid=180&category_id=820">Oxford scientists tested if this difference in language caused the Himba people to actually see colors differently than English-speakers</a>. They showed the Himba volunteers a circle of swatches, all green except for one blue one. Their task was to pick out the blue swatch. Sounds easy enough, but they all struggled and some couldn't do it at all.</p>


            <figure><img src="images/himba/himbaBlueSwatch.png"/><figcaption>It is hard for someone without a word for blue to identify the blue square.</figcaption></figure>
  
 <p> Then the experimenters showed the same volunteers a circle made of green swatches. They were all the same except for one which was only slightly different. The Himba had no trouble picking out the different green, a task Westerners find difficult.</p>

             <figure><img src="images/himba/himbaGreenSwatch.png" /><figcaption>Himba people can easily pick the different green. Can you? <a href="images/himba/himbaAnswerRevealed.png" target="new">(Answer here.)</a></figcaption></figure>
 

             <p>These findings support the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Lingustic Relativity</a> theory, which says that language influences the speaker's world view or cognition. While not air-tight proof that language shapes color perception I for one am inspired to learn more words for green.</p>
