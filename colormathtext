Complementary
A complementary color scheme is a two-color combination consisting of a base color (H0) and another color (H1) that is 180 degrees apart from H0 on the color wheel.

formula: H1 = |(H0 + 180 degrees) - 360 degrees|

Split Complementary
A split-complementary color scheme is a three-color combination that consists of a base color (H0) and two colors (H1 and H2) that are 150 degrees and 210 degrees apart from H0 respectively.

formula: H1 = |(H0 + 150 degrees) - 360 degrees|
formula: H2 = |(H0 + 210 degrees) - 360 degrees|

Triadic
This is a three-color combination that consists of a base color (H0) and two colors (H1 and H2) that are 120 degrees and 240 degrees apart from H0 respectively.

formula: H1 = |(H0 + 120 degrees) - 360 degrees|
formula: H2 = |(H0 + 240 degrees) - 360 degrees|

<p>
Tetradic
A four-color combination that consists of a base color (H0) and three colors (H1, H2, and H3) that are 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees apart from H0 respectively.

formula: H1 = |(H0 + 90 degrees) - 360 degrees|
formula: H2 = |(H0 + 180 degrees) - 360 degrees|
formula: H3 = |(H0 + 270 degrees) - 360 degrees|

<p>
Analagous
Analagous color schemes use a combination consisting of a base color (H0) and one or more adjacent colors (30 degrees apart) on the color wheel.

formula: H1 = |(H0 + 30 degrees) - 360 degrees|
formula: H2 = |(H0 + 60 degrees) - 360 degrees|
formula: H3 = |(H0 + 90 degrees) - 360 degrees|

<p>
Monochrome
A Monochrome color scheme is is where all colors are derived from the base color and the hue value is not changed. Variations in shade or tint are achieved by changing the S-value and/or the B-value for your base color.
