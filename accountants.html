<p>Before the advent of accounting, monarchs spent money without keeping records. They often didn't even know how much they had. When it ran out they simply collected more taxes. </p>

<p>In the 16th century the Dutch changed all that. The Dutch pioneered international trade, and with that they started bookkeeping: publishing and sharing how much went in and how much went out. People had been tracking their personal finances centuries, but this was a first for business and government.</p>

 <p>Monarchs were faced with something hadn't encountered before: transparency and accountability. It was a revolution. Everyone - even the king - was subject to the truth. </p>

<p>Accounting gave power to the people. It was embraced as a civic duty and most Dutch civilians learned accounting in publicly funded schools.</p>

<p>The practice didn't take off in other parts of Europe and in the U.S. until the Industrial Revolution. When production and international trade took off, so did accounting. In only 60 years (1870-1930), the number of accountants in the U.S. increased from circa 54,000 <sup>1</sup> to more than 900,000<sup>2</sup>, a 1600% increase!</p>

<p>In the early American days, accountants apprenticed as bookkeepers. Starting a career as a bookkeeper then working up to owning an accounting firm was a common path. 

<p>But the mechanization of accounting early last century changed that path. Accounting machines turned bookkeeping into a task of operating and maintaining a machine, leaving no time to learn accounting principles. Accountants stayed away from data-entry machines to focus on interpretting the data. The rift grew over the years and by the 1920s the census listed accounting and bookkeeping as separate occupations.</p>

He ended up to owning his own accounting firm. Arther Young (right, shown here in 1890) studied law in Scotland but moved to New York City to pursue a career in accounting, eventually starting a firm with his brother. The two men died within days each other in 1948, never having met. Their firms were later merged into Ernst & Young.</figcaption></figure>


<p>Without apprenticeships as bookkeepers, accountants went to school to get trained. Certificates and degrees took the place of hands-on experience. This narrowed the field to the college-educated and mostly men, since many colleges did not offer accounting courses to women.</p>

 <p>Men remained the majority of accountants until 1997, when women accounted for 54 percent of graduates and 51 percent of new hires in public accounting firms. <sup>3</sup></p>
