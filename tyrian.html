<p>Imperial purple - also known as Tyrian - holds the record as the world's most expensive dye. Why?</p>

<p>Around 500 A.D., merchants in Tyre (in what's now Lebanon) figured out how to  make dye from the snails they caught in the Mediterranean Sea. The recipe is pretty exhausting:</p>

<p>Squeeze thousands of snails until the mucus pops out - a painstaking process because the snails need to remain alive or the mucus discolors. Put in a basin and leave to dry in the sun for several days. The mucus will transform from clear to purple. Add salt-water to thicken, and viola, a rich purple dye.</p>

<figure><img src="images/tyrian/purplesnail.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>Tyrian purple dye comes from the mucus of Bolinus brandaris snails.</figcaption></figure>

<p>It was a slow and expensive process. Twelve thousand snails yielded one gram of dye,  enough for just one handkerchief. A full robe needed 50,000 to 100,000 snails. The cost  meant only royalty could afford to wear Tyrian purple. Some accounts say the dye was worth its weight in silver. Others say it was more precious than gold.</p>

<p>It wasn't so much the color of Tyrian purple - a rusty reddish purple that resembles dried blood - that people valued. It was the quality. Tyrian-dyed garments had a luster that, rather than fading, got richer and brighter with weathering and sunlight.</p>

<figure><img src="images/tyrian/rubens.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>In 1636, Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens painted the discovery Bolinus brandaris snails. According to the legend, the Phoenician god Melcarth (in Greek versions of the myth, it is Hercules), was walking along the beach when his dog began to play with a snail, staining his muzzle.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Real Tyrian purple is still prohibitively expensive and used less often than manufactured purple dyes, which have been available since the 1860s. But its legacy lasts, and its slimy origin is the reason purple is still synonymous with royalty.</p>
