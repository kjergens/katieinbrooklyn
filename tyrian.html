<p>Imperial purple - also known as Tyrian purple after the city Tyre - holds the record as the world's most expensive dye. </p>

<p>As far back as 500 A.D., merchants in Tyre (a city in what's now Lebanon) discovered they could make dye from snails caught in the Mediterranean Sea. They squeezed many snails' mucus into a basin (a painstaking process because the snail needs to remain alive) and left the basin to dry in the sun. Over the course of several days the mucus transformed from clear to purple that, with some salt-water added, could dye fabric rich purple.</p>

<figure><img src="images/tyrian/purplesnail.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>Tyrian purple dye comes from the mucus of Bolinus brandaris snails.</figcaption></figure>

<p>It was a slow and expensive process. Twelve thousand snails yielded just one gram of dye, only enough to dye a handkerchief. A full robe needed 50,000 to 100,000. The cost of the snails and the work meant only royalty could afford to wear Tyrian purple. Some accounts say the dye was worth its weight in silver. Others say it was more precious than gold.</p>

<p>It wasn't so much the color of Tyrian purple - a rusty reddish purple that resembles dried blood - that people valued. It was the quality. Tyrian-dyed garments had a luster that, rather than fading, got richer and brighter with weathering and sunlight.</p>

<figure><img src="images/tyrian/rubens.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>In 1636, Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens painted the discovery Bolinus brandaris snails. According to the legend, the Phoenician god Melcarth (in Greek versions of the myth, it is Hercules), was walking along the beach when his dog began to play with a snail, staining his muzzle.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Real Tyrian purple is still prohibitively expensive and used less often than manufactured purple dyes, which have been available since the 1860s. But its legacy lasts, and its slimy origin is the reason purple is still synonymous with royalty.</p>
