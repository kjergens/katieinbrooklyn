           Pilots used to look like this:
  <figure><img src="images/pilots/ruggedpilot.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

 <p>They were weathered, rugged and made their own rules: the epitome of 1910s masculinity. After all they had one of the world's most dangerous jobs. These were not fighter-pilots, but the corps of U.S. Air Mail carriers.</p>

 <p>Fortune magazine summed up Air Mail pilots: </p>
 
           
           <blockquote>"When they play poker they play all night. When they smoke they smoke too much. When they drink their glasses leak, and when they make love  complaints are rare."
            </blockquote>

<p>In the 1920s all that changed.</p> 
<p>Plane manufacturers wanted to sell to individuals. They needed the public to have a safer image of planes and flying. To that end they took out magazine ads and sponsored cross-oceanic flights featuring pilots who were a bit different from their maverick predecessors.</p>

    <figcaption>In the 1920s and '30s, plane and engine oil companies sponsored flights by young women so flying would seem safe.</figcaption>
  </figure>
 

  <p>Because of these campaigns women pilots - "aviatrixes", lady birds", "lipstick fliers", call them what you will - were all the rage in the 1920s.</p>

<p>The Ladies Aeronautical Society proclaimed:</p>
  <blockquote>"There is no finer past-time for a respectable young woman than to get out in the fresh air and exercise mind and body in the pursuit of the mechanodynamic sciences of flight!"</blockquote>

  <p>The image became so powerful and commonplace it was regularly used in ads for clothing, cigarettes, gum and more.</p>

    <p>In the 1950s things changed again.</p>

    <p>This time commercial airlines got involved. The popular idea that flying is a hobby for young women contradicted their message: planes are serious business. </p>

    <p>So once again the pilot was re-imagined. </p>

    <p>Airlines groomed their pilots to be male and thin. They wore business suits to look professional and a naval caps to look responsible. Lastly, they spoke over an intercom: a faceless voice of authority. The pilot was now a father figure.</p>

 <p>This latest pilot image has endured for over 60 years.</p>
