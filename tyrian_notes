             <li> 10-12,000 murex were needed to produce one gram of dye.</li>
             <li>The dye was greatly prized in antiquity because the colour did not easily fade, but instead became brighter with weathering and sunlight.</li>
             <li> It is believed that the intensity of the purple hue improved rather than faded as the dyed cloth aged.</li>
             <li>The dye substance is a mucous secretion from the hypobranchial gland of one of several species of medium-sized predatory sea snails that are found in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.</li>
             <li>Its significance is such that the name Phoenicia means 'land of purple.</li>
             <li> "Purple for dyes fetched its weight in silver at Colophon" in Asia Minor.</li>
             <li>Snails secrete the mucus to sedate prey (or predators) and protect to their eggs. </li>
             <li>Humans gather it by poking the snails and collecting the mucus (laborious, but it keeps the snails alive to produce more), or simply killing them and extracting the mucus vein.</li>
             <li>Recipe: adds muscus veins to a vat with salt. Soak for 3 days. Skim for vein membrane. Boil for 10 days. Soak a garment for 5 hours. Repeat soaking as needed.</li>
             <li>source of the royal purple dye valued higher than gold in the ancient Near East and ancient Mexico.</li>
             <li>True Tyrian purple, like most high-chroma pigments, cannot be accurately displayed on a computer display. </li>
             <li>The process of making the dye was long, difficult and expensive. Thousands of the tiny snails had to be found, their shells cracked, the snail removed. Mountains of empty shells have been found at the ancient sites of Sidon and Tyre. The snails were left to soak, then a tiny gland was removed and the juice extracted and put in a basin, which was placed in the sunlight. There a remarkable transformation took place. In the sunlight the juice turned white, then yellow-green, then green, then violet, then a red which turned darker and darker. The process had to be stopped at exactly the right time to obtain the desired color, which could range from a bright crimson to a dark purple, the color of dried blood. Then either wool, linen or silk would be dyed. The exact hue varied between crimson and violet, but it was always rich, bright and lasting</li>
             <li>In modern times, Tyrian purple has been recreated, at great expense. When the German chemist, Paul Friedander, tried to recreate Tyrian purple in 2008, he needed twelve thousand mollusks to create 1.4 ounces of dye, enough to color a handkerchief.</li>
             <li>In the year 2000, a gram of Tyrian purple made from ten thousand mollusks according to the original formula, cost two thousand euro.</li>
             <li>What seems to have mattered about Tyrian purple was not its color, but its luster, richness, its resistance to weather and light, and its high price.</li>
