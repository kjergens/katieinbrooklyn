personal accounting
SCRATCHES ON ANCIENT TABLETS show us that accounts have been kept for as long as humans have been able to record them, from ancient Mesopotamians to the Mayans. This kind of accounting was about measuring stores: Merchants and treasurers recorded how much grain, bread, gold, or silver they had. Most ledgers were simple lists of assets or payments.

foreign trade firms, professional accounting
Accounting in the modern sense started around 1300 in medieval Italy, when multipartner firms had to calculate their investments in foreign trade. We don’t know who, if anyone, can take credit for the invention, but it was around this time that double-entry bookkeeping emerged in Tuscany

kings resist
kings and the powerful tended to see themselves above the merchant-like calculations of bookkeeping. They not only hid their wealth and debts: They often did not bother to calculate them

But in one place, the idea of financial accountability did take hold. By the early 1500s, Holland had become the center of global trade, with Antwerp and later Amsterdam acting as the most important ports in the world. Ships arrived laden with spices, exotic fruit, minerals, animals, whale oil, cloths, and other luxury goods. In 1602, the Dutch government in essence created modern capitalism by founding both the first publicly traded company—the Dutch East India Company, or VOC—and the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.

civic and moral duty
It was also seen as a necessary skill for civic participation. Most members of Dutch society were fluent in accounting, having studied at home or in publicly funded city accounting schools.

Keeping one’s books balanced wasn’t simply a matter of law, but an imitation of God, who kept moral accounts of humanity and tallied them in the Books of Life and Death.

In the 17th century, another genre of paintings emerged, showing public administrators holding their books open for all to see.

modern accounting
BY THE LATE 19TH century, accounting had become a profession of its own, rather than fundamentally a shared practice and value. It receded from the lives of individuals, and began to take on more the reputation it holds today.

<blockquote> The mechanization of bookkeeping was a major factor in
 the genderization change of the bookkeeping workforce. With
 a perception as a menial task with few opportunities for ad-
 vancement, bookkeeping became an occupation for women. In
 addition to the demand created by a shortage of male bookkeep-
 ers, women were perceived to have greater manual dexterity
 and greater patience with routine tasks [Oppenheimer, 1968, p.
 227]. Moreover, women could be hired at much lower wages.
 Thus, while accounting remained largely male, women began to
 dominate the bookkeeping workforce. Unlike previously, when
 bookkeepers were paid a "skill" premium in comparison to other
 jobs, the "deskilled" female bookkeeper</blockquote><div class="citation">Accounting Historians Journal 2007, Wooden and Kemmerer: U.S. Mechanical Accounting</div>
